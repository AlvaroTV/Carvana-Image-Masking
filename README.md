# Carvana-Image-Masking
This project features a powerful model designed to automatically remove the background from photos. The model analyzes a diverse dataset of vehicle photos, spanning various years, makes, and models. It leverages cutting-edge techniques like One Cycle Policy for Super-Convergence and employs the U-NET architecture to accurately distinguish between the car and its background. The model's performance is assessed using Dice Coefficient and IoU (Intersection over Union) metrics.  

# Features  
* Automatically removes the background from vehicle photos.
* Trained on a diverse dataset covering a wide range of years, makes, and models.
* Utilizes One Cycle Policy for efficient training and Super-Convergence.
* Employs the U-NET architecture to accurately separate the car from the background.
* Evaluated using Dice Coefficient and IoU metrics for precise assessment.
